# Architecting-For-Machine-Learning
Welcome to the art and science of machine learning! During this 3-day course you will learn about the theoy and application of machine learning in industry. This course is designed for architects and developers who did not previously have a background in AI/ML, to give them intuition and confidence in designing applications.

We will cover:
- Statistical machine learning
- Deep Learning
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Feature engineering
- Deploying a model into production

## Agenda

Day One:
- Learn about ML on AWS
- Go through a sample lab
- Break into teams and focus on a new machine learning project
- Produce a sample writeup explaining your modeling strategy

Day Two: 
- Learn about feature engineering on AWs
- Start new notebooks, sample your code, and develop preliminary data sets
- Read the evaluation questions, and begin to think about 


## What you'll need
- AWS Account log in credentials
- Github account to share code with your project partners
- Kaggle account to download data sets
